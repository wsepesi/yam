# Complete Test Plan - Yam Platform

## Parallelization Strategy for Multiple Claude Code Instances

### 4-Way Parallel Development Phases:
**Week 1-2: Foundation + Security (4 developers)**
- **Developer A:** Test infrastructure setup (factories, mocks, environment)
- **Developer B:** Smoke tests + multi-tenant isolation tests  
- **Developer C:** API contract tests (auth + packages)
- **Developer D:** API contract tests (residents + organizations) + security tests

**Week 2-3: Business Logic + Components (4 developers)**
- **Developer A:** Package management unit tests
- **Developer B:** Data processing & utility tests
- **Developer C:** Critical form component tests
- **Developer D:** Auth components + database safety tests

**Week 3-4: Integration + Performance (2-4 developers)**
- **Developer A:** Build safety + performance budgets
- **Developer B:** Critical integration scenarios
- **Developer C+D:** E2E critical paths (can be split by user role)

### Critical Merge Points (Compact to 1 Claude):
1. **After Week 1:** Merge test infrastructure + coordinate database setup
2. **After Week 2:** Merge all API contracts + validate compatibility  
3. **After Week 3:** Final integration + CI pipeline setup
4. **Week 4:** E2E validation + test suite optimization

### Dependencies:
- **Must be sequential:** Smoke tests → API contracts → Business logic → E2E
- **Can be parallel:** Any tests within same priority level
- **Requires coordination:** Database schema tests, performance budgets

## Autonomous Safety Completion Criteria

When implementing this test plan for autonomous Claude Code safety, the following checkboxes represent the minimum viable protection:

### Core Safety (Must Complete - Week 1-2)
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation tests prevent cross-organization data access
- [ ] API contract tests prevent breaking changes to frontend/backend interfaces  
- [ ] Package ID queue tests prevent duplicate/orphaned package numbers
- [ ] Authentication security tests prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Database constraint tests prevent data corruption

### UX Safety (Must Complete - Week 2-3)  
- [ ] Critical form component tests prevent broken user workflows
- [ ] Build safety tests prevent deployment failures
- [ ] Performance budget tests prevent regression >10%
- [ ] Error recovery tests ensure graceful failure handling

### Integration Safety (Must Complete - Week 3-4)
- [ ] End-to-end critical path tests validate complete user journeys
- [ ] Database RLS policy tests enforce proper data isolation
- [ ] Email notification tests ensure package notifications work
- [ ] Role-based permission tests prevent privilege escalation

**Autonomous Editing Safe Threshold:** When Core Safety + UX Safety items are complete (≥90% of above checkboxes), multiple Claude Code instances can safely edit the codebase simultaneously with minimal risk of breaking core functionality or user experience.
